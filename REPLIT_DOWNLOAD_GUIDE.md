# How to Download Your Project from Replit

## Method 1: Using the Files Panel
1. **Click on "Files" in the left sidebar** (folder icon)
2. **Click the three dots (â‹¯) menu** at the top of the Files panel
3. **Select "Download as zip"** from the dropdown menu
4. **Wait for the download** to start automatically

## Method 2: Using the Shell Command
In the Replit Console/Shell, run:
```bash
zip -r wp-ai-manager.zip . -x "node_modules/*" ".git/*" "*.log"
```
This creates a ZIP file excluding large directories.

## Method 3: Individual File Download
- **Right-click any file** in the Files panel
- **Select "Download"** to download individual files
- Useful for specific files or small projects

## What to Download
Your WP AI Manager project includes:
- `client/` - React frontend
- `server/` - Express backend with admin bypass system
- `shared/` - Database schemas and types
- `package.json` - Project dependencies
- Documentation files (README, guides, etc.)
- Configuration files (tailwind, tsconfig, etc.)

## After Download
Once downloaded, you can:
1. **Extract the ZIP file** locally
2. **Upload to a new Git repository** on GitHub
3. **Set up local development** following the localhost guide
4. **Deploy to other platforms** like Vercel, Netlify, etc.

## File Size Considerations
The download will exclude:
- `node_modules/` (can be reinstalled with `npm install`)
- `.git/` (Git history - you'll need to reinitialize)
- Log files and temporary files

## Backup Strategy
For important projects:
1. **Download regularly** as backup
2. **Push to GitHub** when Git is working
3. **Keep local copies** of critical files
4. **Document your environment setup**

Your project is fully self-contained and will work on any system with Node.js and PostgreSQL.
